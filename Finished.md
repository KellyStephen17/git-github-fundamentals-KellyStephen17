I learned a lot but I think it will still take me some more time to really get comfortable with it. 
-I learned that . will go to the edit part when creating a pull
-I learned how to create my own read.md on my page by naming it my profile name
-I learned how to create a branch and it is a lot easier than I thought it would.
